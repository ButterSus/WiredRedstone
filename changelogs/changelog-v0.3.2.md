# Wired Redstone v0.3.2

Wired Redstone version 0.3.2 for Minecraft 1.18.2

Changes:

* Adds text overlays to gates that indicate things like port names and repeaters' delay. These are visible when looking
  at a gate and crouching.
* Fixed issue where bundled cables would only accept so many `1` signals from a CC: Restitched computer.
