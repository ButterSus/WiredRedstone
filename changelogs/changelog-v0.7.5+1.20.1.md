Changes:

* Fixed wires accidentally powering the blocks behind gates when the wire and gate are at a corner inside the same
  block.
* Fixed wires sometimes not detecting gates as blockage.
* Added Standing Red Alloy Wire.
* Added Standing Insulated Wires.
* Added Standing Bundled Cables.
* Added `wire_gate_connectable` tag for blocks that should only be connected to on the sides and not the top or
  bottom ([**#44**](https://github.com/Kneelawk/WiredRedstone/issues/44)).
