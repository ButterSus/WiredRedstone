# Wired Redstone v0.2.9

Wired Redstone version 0.2.9 for Minecraft 1.18.2

Changes:

* Fixes bug where if repeaters were powered for exactly the wrong amount of time, their output would never turn on.
* Updates GraphLib, making it usable on Windows.
* Updates LibMultiPart to hopefully try and fix a bug where its block-entities were getting loaded too early.
