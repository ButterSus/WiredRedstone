# Wired Redstone v0.2.0

Wired Redstone version 0.2.0 for Minecraft 1.18.2

Changes:

* **MAJOR UPDATE** Changes how wire networks are saved. All existing wires will not function until they are updated with
  a command. Use the command `\graphlib updateblocks <from> <to>` to update the wires in a given area.
* The change allows for improved CPU usage and decreased memory usage.
* Makes uncolored bundled cable use wool sounds and particle effects.
