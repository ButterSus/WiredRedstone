## Pre-Alpha
This project is currently in pre-alpha. Expect bugs, missing items, and sometimes needing to use a command to fix things.

This mod will likely be switching how some of its information is stored, meaning that, when that switch happens, all redstone wire connections will disconnect and you will need to use a command to get them to reconnect.

## Recipes
Recipes? What are those? Who would ever want to use this mod in survival?

I'll add recipes eventually, but I first need to add the machine that the recipes will be in :)

If you really want to use this mod in your survival world, you'll probably want to make a datapack that adds recipes for the parts you need.

## Unlisted
For the time-being, this project should be unlisted until it becomes more stable.
